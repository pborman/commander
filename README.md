# commander
Go package for building commands with sub commands.

This package is useful for writing tools that have subcommands.  An
example of a command with subcommands is `git`.

It uses the github.com/pborman/flags package for declaring flags
in a structured way.  That package is a wrapper around the standard
flags package.
